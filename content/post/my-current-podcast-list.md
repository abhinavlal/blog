After trying podcasts on and off, I boarded the podcast train completely last year. Now all my commute time is spent listening to some fantastic podcasts.

Here is the list of my favourite podcasts currently -

This podcast by overcast creator Marco Arment, along with Casey Liss, and John Siracusa is for avid apple fans.

99% invisible - Absolutely fantastic podcast about design which tells great stories. 99% Invisible is about all the thought that goes into the things we don’t think about — the unnoticed architecture and design that shape our world.

Internet History Podcast - A History Of The Internet Era From Netscape To The iPad. Some fantastic interviews from the past which is very interesting if you love history and internet.

Random Trek - A weekly podcast in which Scott McNulty discusses a randomly selected episode of “Star Trek” — all series, all seasons — with a non-random guest.

This American Life - This American Life is a weekly public radio program and podcast. Each week we choose a theme and put together different kinds of stories on that theme. This American Life is must listen, with 2.2 listeners what more I need to say.

Decoder Ring - Lastly latest edition to my list Decoder ring explains a culture phenomenon and demystifies it. This podcast from slate only had two episodes so far, but I am early waiting for next one.

Apart from this, I have a lot more podcast subscribed, but these enjoy the most.
